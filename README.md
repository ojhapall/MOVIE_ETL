# MOVIE_ETL

The purpose of this repository was to Extract, Transform and Load three large data sets. 

First I wrote a function to read the three data files. Next, I extracted and transformed the Wikipedia Data and the Kaggle Data. Finally I treated a Movie Database that combines information from both data sets and loaded the data to a PostgreSQL Database.  The elapsed time is displayed in the ETL database. It took 3455 seconds to import 26, 024,289 rows of data to SQL.
